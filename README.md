## Stacks Exercises

```
1. Write  a  program  that  reads  in  a  positive  integer  and  prints  the  binary  representation  of  that integer.
  Hint:  divide the integer by 2
```
To run #1, run main from `src/BinaryRep.java`.

```
2. Assume  that  you  are  not  as  careful  programmer  as you  are  and you  frequently  forget  to  close your
brackets while you program â€“ (, {, [ -. Also, because you have not paid attention in writing to write your code in a
proper fashion you find it difficult to find where the mistake is. To help you  while  programming,  construct  a 
program  that  takes  as  input  a  programming  file.  The program should check if all the brackets opened are
correctly closed. For this to happen, there should be as many opening brackets as closing ones. Also, the bracket type
closing must be the same as the one LAST opened.  Amend your program with the following functionality: when an error is
identified write on the console the line and column that the error was found, and specify the expected type of closing
bracket.
```
To run #2, run main from `src/FindBracketErrors.java`.
